I am a software developer based out of Chicago and travelling around helping clients to deliver products as efficiently as possible. On the free time, besides some coding on the free time, I am always looking for a new place to explore as well as trying to keep some level of fitness.

You can find a bit more about me by checking the LinkedIn link below as well as the GitHub one.
