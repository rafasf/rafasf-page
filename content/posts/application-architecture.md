I've had the chance of work with multiple teams in the past years. Interesting enough, even in different environments,
the same conversations will happen.

Conversations:
* Naming
* Where does the logic live (specially when using opinionated frameworks as Rails and Spring)
* HTTP Codes
* Folder / Packaging structure
