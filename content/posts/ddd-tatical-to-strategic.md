Software development enables products to get to the customers. It evolves to
provide a better and sometimes new experiences to its audience.

Given that, all the parties involved should advocate for the product using the
same language as well as having the same goals in mind. Even though that might
sound accurate, why do we encounter development teams using different vocabulary
then their "business"? Why do we have to carry a mental dictonary for every
meeting?

Today I want to explore an approach to narrow that gap. We will go through a
quick journey to bring a technical focused team to be more domain focused.

First, let's align in a few terms:

What does "technical team" mean?

Framework focused, talks a lot about design patters (by the book), heavy use of
service classes (those ending with 'service').

What does "domain focused" mean?

Thinking about the business problems, defining the domain space, what are the
core concepts of the application.

What does a team mean?

The composition of the team is: developers, quality advocates, business
analysts, user experience, product people and possibly some kind of manager(s).

Let's focus on the developers and quality advocates to get this started. The
people that needs to be the most familiar with the architecture and technical
aspects of the product.

The team was already excited about the product, and a few member had already
created a skeleton application using an internal service generator (bringing all
that good framework-basied structure).
